# RFQ Management Page Refactoring

## Overview
This document outlines the refactoring performed on the RFQ Management page (`app/rfq-management/[id]/page.tsx`) to improve code maintainability and organization.

## Problem
The original RFQ Management page was a monolithic 2000+ line file containing all tab components inline, making it:
- Difficult to maintain
- Hard for multiple developers to work on simultaneously
- Prone to merge conflicts
- Complex to understand and debug

## Solution
The page has been refactored by extracting each tab into its own component file, organized in a new `components/rfq-tabs/` directory.

## New Structure

### Created Files:
1. **lib/types/rfq-tabs.ts** - Shared TypeScript interfaces and types
2. **components/rfq-tabs/** - Directory containing all tab components:
   - `PricingTab.tsx` - Pricing analysis table
   - `InventoryTab.tsx` - Inventory status display
   - `MarketDataTab.tsx` - Market data and pricing trends
   - `SettingsTab.tsx` - SKU settings and configuration
   - `HistoryTab.tsx` - Sales history with pricing and quantity sub-tabs
   - `QuotationHistoryTab.tsx` - Quotation version management
   - `ExportTab.tsx` - Export functionality
   - `index.ts` - Barrel export file

### Refactored File:
- **app/rfq-management/[id]/page.tsx** - Significantly reduced from 2000+ lines to ~650 lines

## Key Improvements

### 1. Separation of Concerns
Each tab is now a self-contained component with its own:
- Props interface
- Local state management
- Event handlers
- Rendering logic

### 2. Reusability
Components can be easily:
- Reused in other parts of the application
- Unit tested independently
- Modified without affecting other tabs

### 3. Type Safety
- Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces in `lib/types/rfq-tabs.ts`
- Each component has strongly typed props
- Better IntelliSense and error catching

### 4. Maintainability
- Easier to locate and fix issues
- Multiple developers can work on different tabs simultaneously
- Reduced risk of merge conflicts
- Clear component boundaries

### 5. Performance
- Components can be lazy-loaded if needed
- Better tree-shaking potential
- Smaller bundle sizes per route

## Component Details

### BaseTabProps Interface
All tab components extend from `BaseTabProps` which includes:
- `items`: RFQ items array
- `visibleColumns`: Array of visible column IDs
- `onColumnToggle`: Function to toggle column visibility
- `renderPagination`: Pagination component renderer
- `formatCurrency`: Currency formatting function

### Specialized Props
Some components have additional props:
- **InventoryTab**: `skuDetails` for inventory data
- **HistoryTab**: History data, loading states, and main customers
- **SettingsTab**: Status change and edit handlers
- **QuotationHistoryTab**: Modal states and version management

## Migration Notes

### Preserved Functionality
All original functionality has been preserved:
- Column customization
- Pagination
- Data filtering
- Export capabilities
- Modal interactions
- API integrations

### Code Organization
- Maintained existing naming conventions
- Preserved all business logic
- Kept original CSS classes and styling
- Maintained accessibility features

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Developer Experience**: Easier to navigate and understand codebase
2. **Team Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different tabs
3. **Code Quality**: Better separation of concerns and single responsibility
4. **Testing**: Components can be unit tested in isolation
5. **Future Enhancements**: New features can be added to specific tabs easily
6. **Performance**: Potential for lazy loading and code splitting

## Usage

### Importing Components
```typescript
import {
  PricingTab,
  InventoryTab,
  MarketDataTab,
  SettingsTab,
  HistoryTab,
  QuotationHistoryTab,
  ExportTab
} from '@/components/rfq-tabs';
```

### Using in Main Page
Each tab component is used within `TabsContent`:
```tsx
<TabsContent value="pricing" className="m-0">
  <PricingTab
    items={items}
    visibleColumns={visibleColumns.pricing}
    onColumnToggle={(columnId) => handleColumnToggle('pricing', columnId)}
    renderPagination={renderPagination}
    formatCurrency={formatCurrency}
  />
</TabsContent>
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Lazy Loading**: Implement React.lazy() for tab components
2. **State Management**: Consider using Redux or Zustand for complex state
3. **Error Boundaries**: Add error boundaries around tab components
4. **Performance Optimization**: Memoize heavy computations
5. **Testing**: Add comprehensive unit tests for each component

## Conclusion

This refactoring significantly improves the maintainability and developer experience of the RFQ Management system while preserving all existing functionality. The modular approach makes the codebase more scalable and easier to work with for development teams.
