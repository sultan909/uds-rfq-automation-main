# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Documentation and architecture standardization following stability milestone
- Establishing consistent component and development patterns
- Updating project planning and memory bank to reflect current state
- Preparing for next development phase with established best practices

## Recent Changes
- **DOCUMENTATION UPDATE**: Updated PLANNING.md to reflect current project status and Phase 2 progress (80% complete)
- **STANDARDS ESTABLISHED**: Added comprehensive table component guidelines to .cursorrules
- **ARCHITECTURE PATTERNS**: Documented shadcn/ui as standard table library with PrimeReact as exception case
- **PROJECT INTELLIGENCE**: Enhanced .cursorrules with table implementation patterns and data safety requirements
- **MEMORY BANK SYNC**: Updated all memory bank files to reflect current stable state
- **CRITICAL MILESTONE DOCUMENTED**: Application stability restoration and error handling patterns established
- Enhanced error handling patterns now serve as template for future development
- Currency formatting system established as robust foundation for financial displays

## Next Steps
- Begin Phase 3 planning for integrations (QuickBooks, email parsing, marketplace connectors)
- Apply established patterns to remaining components requiring table implementations
- Continue implementing PRD features with established error handling standards
- Enhance data validation at API level using documented patterns
- Expand table component ecosystem following shadcn/ui standards

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **STANDARD ESTABLISHED**: shadcn/ui Table components as primary choice for all tables
- **EXCEPTION CRITERIA**: PrimeReact only for advanced features (virtual scrolling, tree tables) with approval
- **CONSISTENCY PRIORITY**: Maintaining uniform table implementation across application
- **PATTERN INHERITANCE**: All new financial components must follow established error handling patterns
- **DOCUMENTATION FIRST**: All architectural decisions must be documented in .cursorrules and memory bank
- **PHASE-BASED DEVELOPMENT**: Clear milestone tracking with 80% Phase 2 completion achieved
