# Progress

## What Works
- **STABLE**: RFQ Management Detail page now handles all data edge cases without crashing
- **ROBUST**: Currency formatting system with comprehensive error handling (NaN, null, undefined protection)
- **DOCUMENTED**: Comprehensive project planning and architecture standards established
- **STANDARDIZED**: Table component implementation patterns documented and enforced
- Enhanced formatCurrency function prevents React crashes and displays proper fallback values
- Quotation history table displays pricing data safely with proper null checks
- Sales history sections (pricing/quantity) handle missing customer data gracefully
- RFQ overview section displays totalBudget with proper fallback handling
- All financial displays throughout RFQ Detail page are crash-resistant
- **PROJECT INTELLIGENCE**: .cursorrules contains comprehensive development patterns and standards
- **PLANNING ALIGNMENT**: PLANNING.md accurately reflects current Phase 2 status (80% complete)
- Memory Bank documentation structure maintained and up-to-date
- Customer view, edit, and history pages implemented with navigation from the customer list
- Inventory detail page includes SKU item history section
- Sidebar is collapsible, toggle button is always visible, and tooltips are shown in collapsed mode
- Create Quote page implemented for RFQs, accessible from both RFQ Management and RFQ Detail pages
- SKU mapping dialog is reusable, supports full CRUD, and integrates with backend (PUT method)
- Customer autocomplete and batch update logic for SKU mapping
- AllMappings and RecentlyAdded tabs use shared dialog and backend sync

## What's Left to Build
- **PHASE 3**: QuickBooks integration, email parsing, marketplace connectors (documented in PLANNING.md)
- Apply established table patterns to remaining components requiring data display
- Enhance API-level data validation using documented defensive programming patterns
- Continue implementing advanced PRD features with established error handling standards
- Further UI/UX refinements based on user feedback
- Ongoing accessibility and usability improvements
- Monitor and optimize backend-frontend sync for SKU mapping

## Current Status
- **PHASE 2 MILESTONE**: 80% complete with major stability and architecture achievements
- **DOCUMENTATION COMPLETE**: All architectural decisions and patterns documented
- **STANDARDS ESTABLISHED**: Component usage guidelines and error handling patterns in place
- **READY FOR PHASE 3**: Foundation solid for integration development
- RFQ Management system is production-ready with robust data validation
- Currency formatting patterns established as template for other components

## Known Issues
- No critical issues remaining
- **TABLE IMPLEMENTATION**: Must follow shadcn/ui standards unless advanced features require PrimeReact approval
- Need to propagate defensive programming patterns to other financial components
- Backend-frontend sync for SKU mapping continues to be monitored
- API data validation could be strengthened to prevent edge cases at source
