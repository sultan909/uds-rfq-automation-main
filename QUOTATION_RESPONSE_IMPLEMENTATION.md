# Quotation Response System Implementation Summary

## Overview
The quotation response system has been successfully implemented to allow SKU-level tracking of customer responses to quotations. This enhancement extends the existing quotation history functionality with detailed response management.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- **New Tables Created:**
  - `quotation_responses`: Stores overall response details for each quotation version
  - `quotation_response_items`: Stores SKU-level response details with status and pricing

### 2. Database Migration
- **File:** `drizzle/0003_add_quotation_responses.sql`
- Creates tables with proper foreign key relationships
- Adds performance indexes
- Includes unique constraints for data integrity

### 3. TypeScript Types
- **File:** `lib/types/quotation-response.ts`
- Defines comprehensive types for response statuses, items, and API requests
- Includes type-safe enums for response statuses and communication methods

### 4. API Endpoints
- **GET** `/api/rfq/[id]/quotation/[versionId]/responses` - Get all responses for a version
- **POST** `/api/rfq/[id]/quotation/[versionId]/responses` - Create new response
- **GET** `/api/rfq/[id]/quotation/[versionId]/responses/[responseId]` - Get specific response

### 5. UI Components

#### Main Components:
- **QuotationResponseModal**: Main modal for recording responses
- **QuotationResponseForm**: Form component with response details
- **ResponseFormFields**: Basic response information fields
- **ResponseItemsTable**: SKU-level response management table

#### Enhanced Components:
- **QuotationHistoryTab**: Added detailed response functionality
- **QuotationHistoryTable**: Added new column for detailed responses

### 6. API Client Integration
- **File:** `lib/api-client.ts`
- Added new methods:
  - `getQuotationResponses()`
  - `createQuotationResponse()`
  - `getQuotationResponse()`

### 7. Main Page Integration
- **File:** `app/rfq-management/[id]/page.tsx`
- Added `handleRecordQuotationResponse()` function
- Integrated with existing quotation history workflow

## Key Features

### Response Status Tracking
- **Overall Status**: PENDING, ACCEPTED, DECLINED, PARTIAL_ACCEPTED, NEGOTIATING
- **Item Status**: PENDING, ACCEPTED, DECLINED, COUNTER_PROPOSED, NEEDS_CLARIFICATION

### SKU-Level Details
- Individual status for each SKU
- Requested quantity and pricing changes
- Item-specific comments and suggestions
- Alternative product suggestions
- Delivery requirements

### Communication Tracking
- Communication method (Email, Phone, Meeting, Portal)
- Customer contact person
- Response date tracking
- Special instructions and payment terms

## How to Use

### Recording a Response
1. Navigate to RFQ Detail page
2. Go to "Quotation History" tab
3. Find the desired quotation version
4. Click "Record Detailed Response"
5. Fill in overall response details
6. Set status and details for each SKU
7. Save the response

## Integration Points
- Seamlessly integrates with existing quotation history
- Maintains compatibility with current RFQ workflow
- Extends the existing UI without breaking changes
- Follows established coding patterns and standards

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)
1. Add response analytics and reporting
2. Implement response timeline visualization
3. Add bulk response operations
4. Create response templates for common scenarios
5. Add export functionality for response data

The implementation provides a comprehensive solution for tracking detailed customer responses at the SKU level while maintaining the existing system's integrity and user experience.
